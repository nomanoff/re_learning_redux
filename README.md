> "Hello world. I decided to put some time to really learn what redux is all about. I have personally found it really really difficult to work with and always tried to avoid using it in my devlopment journey. But I always felt that one day it would bite me in the toe when I have to use it. So, I want to spend a meaningful amount of time to study redux from the bottom of my heart. I don't know how this journey will end but at least I want to try." - Azizbek Nomanoff, 2022.06.02

### What is Redux, anyway?

> Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions".

It helps us to manage the state of our app or website.

### Why Should I Use Redux?

Redux helps to manage the global state = state that is needed across many parts of your application.

The patterns and tools provided by Redux make it easieri to understand when, where, why and how the state in your application is being updated, and how your application login will behave when those changes occur.

Predictable and Testable

## Redux Terms and Concepts

### State Management

- The state, the source of truth that drives our app;
- The view, a declarative description of the UI based on the current state
- The actions, the events that occur in the app based on user input, and trigger updates in the state
