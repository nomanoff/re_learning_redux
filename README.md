> "Hello world. I decided to put some time to really learn what redux is all about. I have personally found it really really difficult to work with and always tried to avoid using it in my devlopment journey. But I always felt that one day it would bite me in the toe when I have to use it. So, I want to spend a meaningful amount of time to study redux from the bottom of my heart. I don't know how this journey will end but at least I want to try."
